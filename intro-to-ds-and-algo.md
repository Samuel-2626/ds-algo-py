# Data Structures and Algorithm

Data structures are building blocks or raw materials for any software program.

One cannot become a good programmer without a sound understanding of data structures.

Use the right data structure for a problem.

DS are containers storing data in a specific memory layout.

Big O notation is used to measure how running time or space requirements for your program grow
as the input size grows.

Measuring running time growth -> Time complexity

Measuring space growth -> Space complexity

Data structures and algorithms are very important, especially in programming interviews.

Data structure is a way of organizing data inside your computer's memory.

------

On the order of (Big O) of n
- O(n<sup>2</sup>)
- O(n logn)
- O(n)
- O(log n)
- O(1)

Example:

Worst case - O(n) #upper bound
Best case - Î©(1) #lower bound
