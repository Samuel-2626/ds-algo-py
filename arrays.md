# Arrays

Arrays are the most commonly used data structures in any programming language.

The index lookup for an array will be O(1), which is a constant time operation.

Note that Big O complexity is often looking at worst-case analysis.

Lookup by the value of an array = O(n).

Array traversal = O(n).

Array insertion = O(n).

Array deletion = O(n).

In Python, a list is implemented as a dynamic array. In other languages like Java, and C++, we have static and dynamic arrays.

Arrays can store numbers, text, or complex objects. Python lists specifically can store multiple types of elements. For instance, int and str.

We also have a two-dimensional array.
